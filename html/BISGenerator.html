    <h1>FORMATTING GUIDELINES</h1>
    <p>This tool is used to convert a Service Agreement ".docx" file to a Building Inspection Sheet instantly. It requires some simple formatting of the Service Agreement in order to work correctly. Either follow <a href="https://gocitywide0.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/Illinois/EZvDlcerurxHsfy1SFXzaQYBpX0PwkFoLaaAXcUbfu8IQg?e=vefSS7" target="_blank">this template</a> to make your Service Agreement, or update your existing Service Agreement to include the following formatting.</p>
    <p style="color:red; font-size:20px">DISCLAIMER: This tool is prone to mistakes if the formatting of the Service Agreement is not exact. After using, always do a quick review of the generated BIS to ensure no mistakes were made.</p>
